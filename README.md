# Multi-tenant data lakehouse for SaaS workshop

This is the source code for the Multi-tenant data lakehouse for SaaS workshop.

This Level 400 hands-on workshop guides you through building a **multi-tenant data lakehouse** to securely ingest, store, govern, and access tenant data.

The workshop addresses key data challenges in SaaS applications:
- **Data ingestion and storage**: Securely ingest and store tenant data
- **Data isolation**: Implement multi-tenant strategies for AI agents to access only authorized data  
- **Governance and access control**: Manage permissions for AI agents in multi-tenant environments
